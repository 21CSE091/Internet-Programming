<h2>FEATURES:</h2>
<b>
<li>A scooter is a motorcycle with an underbone or step-through frame, a seat, and a platform for the rider's feet, emphasizing comfort and fuel economy.</li>
<li>Elements of scooter design were present in some of the earliest motorcycles, and motor scooters have been made since at least 1914.</li>
<li>The global popularity of motor scooters dates from the post-World War II introductions of the Vespa and Lambretta models in Italy.</li>
<li>Motor scooters are very popular in Asia, particularly in countries such as India, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Japan and Taiwan where there is local manufacturing.</li> 
<li>Scooters may be powered by an electric motor powered by a rechargeable battery.</li>
<li>Electric scooters are rising in popularity because of higher gasoline prices, and battery technology is gradually improving, making this form of transportation more practical.</li>
<li>Scooters are popular for personal transportation partly due to being more affordable, easier to operate, and more convenient to park and store than a car.</li>
<li>Licensing requirements for scooters are easier and cheaper than for cars in most parts of the world, and insurance is usually cheaper.</li>
<li>Some scooters, including the BMW C1 and the Honda Gyro Canopy, have a windscreen and a roof. The Piaggio MP3 offered a tall windscreen with roof as an option.</li>
<li>High-end scooter models now include comprehensive technological features, including cast aluminium frames, engines with integral counterbalancing, and cross-linked brake systems.</li>
