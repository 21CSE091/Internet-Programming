<h1 style="text-align: left;color:#2D68C4">LIVING ON CAMPUS</h1>
<p style="font-size:18px"> To experience university life fully, nothing equals living on campus where students can enjoy convenience and a sense of community. 
UCLA’s on-campus housing is situated at the heart of university life and is just a short walk away from classrooms, laboratories, libraries, and sports facilities. 
With housing and dining needs met, students are free to concentrate on being a full-time student.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">As part of a diverse community of over 11,000 undergraduates, students have many opportunities for interaction that contribute to their academic success and personal growth. 
Studies show that students who live on campus perform better academically, have more contact with faculty, and are happier with their college experience than students who commute. 
Students can choose from several on-campus housing options, all of which encourage discovery and emphasize community.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px">In order to continue support of the University's academic mission through its housing program, UCLA Housing & Hospitality Services has been charged with adding approximately 1,500 
bed spaces and renovating existing high-rise residence halls. To learn more about these projects please visit our Housing Construction web page.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: left;color:#2D68C4">UCLA'S RESIDENCE</h1>
<p style="font-size:18px">UCLA’s highrise residence halls are co-ed, with separate community restrooms and showers for men and women. Most rooms in the residence halls will be shared by 
three students while the remaining rooms will have two student occupants. Residence hall amenities include furnished rooms with basic cable TV service and computer network connections
 in every room. There are laundry facilities in each building. One building has a learning center and computer lab and all have study lounges. Most buildings have 24-hour front desk
 services for messages and drop-off deliveries and a residential restaurant on the premises or nearby. The four original residence halls, referred to as Classic, are Dykstra, Hedrick,
 Rieber, and Sproul.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: left;color:#2D68C4">ARTS & PERFORMANCE</h1>
<p style="font-size:18px">Every year more than 500,000 people flock to campus to take in more than 1,000 visual, performing and media arts events created by both professionals and gifted
 students. As a creator or a spectator, your artistic spirit will soar in UCLA’s thriving arts community, in the cultural capital of Los Angeles.</p>
<p style="font-size:18px">UCLA has a rich tradition of student-led arts organizations that provide opportunities for students to gain experience producing their own events. 
Student-run events include Spring Sing and Arts in the Union. Weekly and monthly happenings include concerts at Kerckhoff Coffee House. Whether it’s a cappella voices, hip-hop poets, 
jazz musicians, Bollywood dancers, stand-up comics or crowd-pleasing musicians, our students shine.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: left;color:#2D68C4">VOLUNTEER CENTER</h1>
<p style="font-size:18px">The UCLA Volunteer Center coordinates service activities on campus and throughout Greater Los Angeles to inspire members of the extended UCLA family to give
 their time and talent. As part of the Student Affairs division, the Center strives to make a positive impact upon UCLA and the Greater Los Angeles community. At UCLA, there are many
 ways to give back to the community. Through the Volunteer Center, students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members can participate in ongoing and annual service opportunities,
 suggest volunteer site locations, and lead service projects. The Volunteer Center also maintains an online listing of campus-wide service groups, and a volunteer database of community 
service opportunities. The UCLA Volunteer Center's mission is to inspire the more than 500,000 members of the extended UCLA family, as well as the community at large, to create social
 change through lifelong participation in volunteer programs and civic engagement.</p>
