<h2>FEATURES:</h2>
<b>
<li>A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying cargo or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, 
such as defense, research and fishing.</li>
<li>Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity and purpose.</li> 
<li>Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization and science.</li>
<li>Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.</li>
<li>Ships undergo nearly constant maintenance during their career, whether they be underway, pierside, or in some cases, in periods of reduced operating status between charters or
 shipping seasons.</li>
<li>Most ocean-going cargo ships have a life expectancy of between 20 and 30 years.</li>
<li>The bow is the front first part of the ship to make contact with the sea,& it controls how waves interact with the ship. A bow help reduces the resistance of the hull as it cuts
 through the water.</li>
<li>An anchor is a device, usually made of metal, used to secure a vessel to prevent it from drifting away.</li>
<li>A ship has a rudder. The rudder helps the ship turn towards the direction it wishes to go. Rudders are installed at the aft to boost the ship’s hydrodynamic efficiency.</li>
<li>A ship’s propeller is a rotating, fan that uses power transmitted by the ship’s primary engine. When the propeller starts to rotate in the water, its blades transform the
power of rotation into thrust.Without the propeller, the vessel can’t move ahead or aster ― the propellers are like the “wheels” of the ship.</li>
